# Snap — Agent Guide

Snap is a super fast, native Wayland screenshot and annotation overlay,
built for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) on Hyprland. It captures region,
window, or full monitor (plus a scrolling-region mode that stitches a taller
page into one image), then copies it and opens a floating compositor preview.
The preview fades after 10 seconds of idle time unless kept with its pin button,
Ctrl+P, or by dragging it, including within the stack. Hovering and in-progress
actions pause its countdown.
It opens an annotation editor on demand, with vector layers
(arrows, lines, freehand, highlighter, rectangles, ellipses, numbered
markers, text, OCR). Finished captures go to clipboard,
`~/Pictures/Screenshots`, or a floating capture pinned across workspaces.

## Project principles

Each of these has a longer writeup under `docs/` — read it before making a
change that touches the principle, not just this summary.

- **A specialized tool, not a general app.** Snap does one job — capture,
  annotate, output — and does it fast. It is not a drawing program, not a
  file manager, not a general Wayland utility. A feature that isn't in
  service of "screenshot, mark it up, send it somewhere" doesn't belong
  here, however useful it might be on its own.
- **The main thread never blocks.** Capture, paint, and input handling are
  the UI thread's whole job. Disk I/O on a full-resolution image, spawning
  a process, PNG encoding — all of it runs on a worker via
  `QtConcurrent`/`QFutureWatcher`, never inline. See
  [docs/threading.md](docs/threading.md).
- **Every operation is undoable.** The operation log is the source of
  truth; the visible image is rebuilt from it. Rendering for editing is a
  pure, repeatable function of that log — nothing is baked into the working
  image as you draw. Fresh captures copy and show a timed preview by default;
  during editing, output is applied only on **Copy**, **Save**, or both
  (or an explicit pin or a return to its preview),
  which is the one moment a flattened image is produced. Redaction is the
  deliberate, documented exception: it must actually destroy pixels at
  render time so nothing recoverable leaks into an export, while remaining
  a normal, undoable log entry until you export. See
  [docs/editing-model.md](docs/editing-model.md).
- **Minimally configurable — pre-configured to be right, like Omarchy.**
  No settings UI, no wizards, no onboarding. The defaults are the product;
  a config key is a narrow escape hatch for a real divergent need (where to
  save, what to name it, preset colors), never a general mechanism. Adding
  a new key needs the same justification the existing ones had, not "this
  would be nice to expose."
- **Speed first.** Instant capture, annotate, copy. No startup bloat.
- **Wayland only, Hyprland only.** Monitor/window discovery, input
  injection quirks, and notification conventions are all Hyprland-specific
  on purpose. Code that happens to also run on another wlroots compositor,
  because it stands on a real Wayland protocol rather than a Hyprland
  shortcut, is a fine accident — it is not a target, not tested, and not a
  bug magnet we chase. A PR that supports another compositor (niri, KDE,
  etc.) is welcome **only if it adds zero complexity to the Hyprland
  path** — no compositor branching, no backend abstraction, no new
  dependency pulled in just for it. Otherwise it's rejected; fork it
  instead. No X11, no macOS/Windows. See
  [docs/platform-scope.md](docs/platform-scope.md).
- **Lean, learned dependencies.** The dependency set is Qt6 + LayerShellQt +
  wayland-client + libdeflate, plus shelling out to a few existing Omarchy tools
  (`hyprctl`, `wl-copy`/`wl-paste`, `tesseract`, `omarchy-notification-send`)
  instead of linking their equivalents in-process. Know this list before
  proposing an addition to it. See [docs/dependencies.md](docs/dependencies.md).
- **Single small binary.** Everything (capture, editor, pin mode, scroll
  capture) runs from the one `snap` executable. Every new dependency or
  vendored asset is weight every install carries.
- **No backwards compatibility.** Break keybindings, CLI flags, file
  formats, or internals whenever it keeps the code simpler or the tool
  faster. Do not add compatibility shims, deprecation aliases, or migration
  code.
- **Omarchy aesthetics.** `omarchy-notification-send` when available,
  `SNAP_OCR_LANGS`/`OMARCHY_OCR_LANGS` fallback for OCR languages,
  minimal vector-drawn icons (no icon-theme dependency), and the system font
  for annotation text. Chrome text uses `chromeFont()`/`chromeMonoFont()`
  (`src/overlay-chrome.cpp`), pinned in code, and `main()` installs
  `chromeDefaultFont()` as the application font; external desktop platform
  themes are deliberately bypassed at startup in favour of Qt's built-in
  `generic` theme (see [docs/dependencies.md](docs/dependencies.md)). Chrome
  must use the pinned fonts and explicit colours; do not derive chrome from
  `QFontDatabase::systemFont`, `QStyle`, or `palette()`.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/main.cpp` | CLI parsing, single-instance lock, mode dispatch |
| `src/instance-lock.cpp/.hpp` | Single-instance handover: cancel a running overlay, or stop it and take over for `--file` |
| `src/capture.cpp/.hpp` | Capture, render pipeline, output (clipboard/save/notify), source+JSON operation-log persistence, config loading glue |
| `src/editor.cpp/.hpp` | Annotation editor: tools, vector layers, operation-log undo/redo, the select↔edit phase machine, export |
| `src/overlay-chrome.cpp/.hpp` | Shared chrome every overlay wears: the capture-kind tab strip, hotkey legend, status pill |
| `src/scroll-capture.cpp/.hpp` | The scroll-capture panel: region-live page, manual/auto mode, grips, stitched result |
| `src/scroll-inject.cpp/.hpp` | Auto-scroll wheel injection (uinput / `zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1`) |
| `src/auto-capture.cpp/.hpp`, `src/stitch.cpp/.hpp` | Pure, offline-testable frame classification and stitching |
| `src/stitch-replay.cpp` | Standalone tool: replay a dumped frame directory through the stitcher with no compositor |
| `src/surface-capture.cpp` | In-process output/window capture via `ext-image-copy-capture` |
| `src/cut.cpp/.hpp` | Cut-band tool: remove a strip and collapse the gap |
| `src/recent-snaps.cpp/.hpp` | The recents shelf: shelving/reopening working documents |
| `src/output-config.cpp/.hpp`, `src/palette-config.cpp/.hpp` | The optional `snap.conf` INI: output destination/filename, color presets |
| `src/pin.cpp/.hpp`, `src/pin-file.cpp/.hpp`, `src/pin-layout.cpp/.hpp` | Floating pinned captures, their files, and compositor placement |
| `src/pin-expiry.cpp/.hpp` | Preview countdown, interaction pauses, and fade |
| `src/icons.cpp/.hpp` | Vector icon renderer for toolbar and pin controls |
| `src/cli-path.cpp/.hpp` | Command-line image target resolution |
| `src/eyedropper.cpp/.hpp` | Display-to-source color sampling |
| `tests/*-smoke.cpp/.hpp` | Headless Qt Test coverage: offscreen region clicks, async capture, single-instance handover, stitching fixtures |
| `docs/` | Longer writeups of the principles above — read before changing behavior they cover |
| `xmake.lua` | Build definition; **the version lives here** (`local version = "1.21.0"`) |

## Build and verify

```bash
xmake -y
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen ./build/snap-smoke ./build/snap-smoke-output
```

`xmake -y` builds every target (`snap`, `snap-core`, `snap-smoke`,
`stitch-replay`). The second command runs the complete headless offscreen Qt
smoke suite (including simulated region clicks and asynchronous capture).
`xmake install` installs to `~/.local` — the app binary plus the Lucide
license; the dev targets are excluded from install.

Always run the build and smoke suite after behavioral changes. CI
(`.github/workflows/build-linux.yml`) runs the same build and smoke on every
push and PR.

Dependencies (Arch): `base-devel xmake pkgconf qt6-base layer-shell-qt
wayland wayland-protocols libdeflate wl-clipboard xdg-utils tesseract tesseract-data-eng`. See
[docs/dependencies.md](docs/dependencies.md) before adding to this list.

## Release process

1. Bump `local version` in `xmake.lua`.
   Move the `Unreleased` entries in `CHANGELOG.md` into that version's
   section, add its comparison link, and start a fresh `Unreleased` section.
   Update the Unreleased comparison link to compare the new tag with `main`.
2. Build and run the smoke test (above).
3. Commit, tag `v<version>`, push main and the tag. The GitHub workflow
   attaches the build artifact to the release automatically.
   Copy the new changelog section into the GitHub release notes so users
   can read the changes alongside the download.

See `README.md` for user-facing features, keybindings, and install
instructions — keep it in sync when behavior changes.
